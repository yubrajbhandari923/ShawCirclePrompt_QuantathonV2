Open `shaw_circle_challenge.ipynb` to get started on the challenge.


### **Problem Statement - Detecting and Analyzing Financial Principal Components with QAPCA** üíπ
This challenge will have competitors build L1-PCA classically, followed by QAPCA-R, in order to visualize the natural groupings of different tickers into sectors from price movements. Competitors will be tested on how robustly their implementation manages noise from both the quantum system and the data itself.


### **Submission Procedure** üì•
During the final hour of the Hackathon, competitors will receive a form where they will submit  
a) a link to their public github repository and   
b) their presentation, either in the form of a powerpoint or a PDF of their slides.  
***Do not edit your repository or your presentation slides after the hackathon stop time!!!***


### **Judging Criteria** üèÜ
Demonstrates Fundamentals Understanding (20%)
- Demonstrating clear knowledge of quantum principles and PCA fundamentals, connecting theoretical concepts to implementation choices.  

Creativity & Innovation (30%)
- Exploring novel approaches to formulating or solving the problem, going beyond ‚Äútextbook‚Äù solutions. Solving bonus problems.

Accuracy and Technical Soundness (25%)
- Correctness of the formulation, accuracy and stability of results, proper handling of scaling, penalties, and constraints.

Code Quality & Reproducibility (10%)
- Code is clean, well-organized, and documented, can be easily re-run by judges without extensive modification.

Presentation & Communication (15%)
- Clear and engaging presentation of results, both in the notebook and live pitch.
