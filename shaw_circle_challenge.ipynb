    "1. Why use Principal Component Analysis (PCA)? How to use PCA?\n",
    "2. Apply PCA to a dataset. Form statistical conclusions per results.\n",
    "3. Understand and mitigate the impact of outliers and noisy data.\n",

    "#### **Principal Component Analysis**\n",
    "*Principal Component Analysis* (PCA) is a common data science procedure used for extracting key features (aka principal components) from a dataset. Knowing the principal components is helpful for dimensionality reduction, denoising, and visualization.  \n",
    "For an intuitive understanding of PCA, here is a [great rundown from IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/principal-component-analysis) and youtube has a plethora of instructive videos. Develop an understanding of the fundamentals before continuing.  \n",
    "Understand both the recursive formulation of PCA and the implementation that solves for several principal components simultaneously.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Quantum Annealing**\n",
    "*Quantum Annealing* (QA) is an optimization algorithm for finding the global minimum of a solution set. It works by creating quantum fluctations in input data to explore the dataset.  \n",
    "For an intuitive understanding of QA, there are also some youtube videos that have great visualizers. Here is a [great video](https://youtu.be/zvfkXjzzYOo?si=t1X2Nl-277pAQDV4) from D-Wave.\n",

    "### **QaPCA**\n",
    "*Quantum Annealing for Robust Principal Component Analysis* ([pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10431)), published in December 2024, introduced an implementation of PCA using Quantum Annealing. The goal of the article was to develop a *robust* implementation, i.e. an implementation that mitigated the impact of noise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement - Detecting and Analyzing Financial Principal Components with QAPCA**\n",
    "This challenge will have competitors build L1-PCA classically, followed by QAPCA-R, in order to visualize the natural groupings of different tickers into sectors from price movements. Competitors will be tested on how robustly their implementation manages noise from both the quantum system and the data itself.\n",
